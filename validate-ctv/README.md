# Validate CRAN Task View

This GitHub action validates proposed changes to a CRAN task view.
It is designed for use in the `cran-task-views` GitHub repository, but can
be run in any user repository using the `user` option.

# Using this workflow

Create a file `user/TaskViewName/.github/actions/validate-ctv.yml`, containing:

```yml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/validate-ctv.yml'
      - '<TaskViewName>.md'
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
    paths:
      - '.github/workflows/validate-ctv.yml'
      - '<TaskViewName>.md'

name: Validate task view

jobs:
  validate-ctv:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: ms609/actions/validate-ctv@main
        with:
          task-view: <TaskViewName>
```

Replace `<TaskViewName>` with the name of the task view.
The task view should be contained in a file named `TaskViewName.md` in the
`user/TaskViewName` github repository.
